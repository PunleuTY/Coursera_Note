# Introduction
**Data Science** is way of using data to answer the questions.  It involves statistic, computer science, math, data cleaning & visualization.

*Few qualities that characterize the big data is called the 3' V's of big data:* 
- `Volume` : Refers to amount of data
- `Velocity` : Refers to the speed of data processing
