*Jupyter* 
**Jupyter** is a web application that allows us to create, share, document, or even coding, visualization. It is support many types of programming language such as Python, R, Julia, etc. 

It really useful in data science field because its interactive interface data exploration, result visualization and algorithms experimentation 

**Summary** : Key features of Jupyter 
- Rich Output
- Interactive Computing
- Integration with DS Libraries
- Collaboration and sharing
- Support with multiple programming language 

**Real Number** : 21.21 (float)
