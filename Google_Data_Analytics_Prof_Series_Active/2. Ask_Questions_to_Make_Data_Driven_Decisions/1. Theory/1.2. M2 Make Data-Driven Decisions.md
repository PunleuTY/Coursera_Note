- Quantitative data: Specific, and objective measure of numerical facts
	- Problem question : The what ? How often?  How many ? 
- Qualitative data: Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics 
	- Problem question : Why ?

There are 2 types of presenting the data we have:
- **Report** : Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically 
	- Pros : 
		- High-level historical data
		- Easy to design
		- Pre-cleaned and sorted data
	- Cons:
		- Continual maintainance 
		- Less visually appealing
		- Static
- **Dashboard** : Monitor live, incoming data
	- Pros:
		- Dynamic, automatic and interactive  
		- More stakeholder access
		- Low maintenance 
	- Cons:
		- Labor-intensive design
		- Can be confusing
		- Potentially uncleaned data

<u>Pivot Table</u>
Pivot table is a data summarization tool that used in data processing. They are also used to summarize, sort, count, reorganize, group, total or average data stored in database.  

<u> Metric</u>
Metric is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement.
Metric can also be used calculate the customer retention rates or company's ability to keep its customers overtime. 
- Customer retention rate helps business to compare the number of customer in beginning and the end of a period of time, to see their retention rate. By knowing the retention rate, company can knows how successful their marketing strategies are 

<u>ROI</u> 
Return of Investment ROI is essentially a formula designed using metric that business know how well investment of  business is doing. It is made of two metrics 
```
ROI =  the net profit over a period of time / the cost of investment 
```

<u>Type of Dashbaord</u>
There are 3 common types of dashboard:
- **Strategic dashboard**: used in business to evaluating and aligning their strategic goals. They typically contains information that is useful for enterprise-wide decision-making.
  Below is an example of a strategic dashboard which focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) over a year.

- **Operational dashboard**: The most common type of dashboard that visual time scale of day, weeks, or months, they can provide performance insight almost in real-time.
  This allows businesses to track and maintain their immediate operational processes in light of their strategic goals. The operational dashboard below focuses on customer service.
![[Pasted image 20260107152856.png]]
- **Analytical dashboard**: contains vast amount of data used by data analysts. Used to visual the detailed that involved usage, analysis, and predictions.
  The analytic dashboard below focuses on metrics for a company’s financial performance.

- How are the different types of dashboards similar to each other?
- In what ways do they differ?

Write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

```Answer
1. All dashboards exist for one reason: to turn messy data into clear decisions.
	- Collect data from one or more sources
	- Process and summarize that data
	- Visualize information in a human-friendly way
	- Support decision-making (fast or slow, big or small)
	  
2. The similarity of these dashboard:
- All dashboard types turn data into information for decision-making.
- They all answer questions using KPIs and metrics.
- They visualize data to make it easier to understand quickly.
- They are designed for specific users and their needs.
- They simplify complex data into clear insights.
- They all depend on accurate and reliable data.
```

Question 2

Now that you have considered the different types of dashboards, think about the impact that dashboards can have on a company:

- What is an example of a data source a company might use with a dashboard?
- How would a company benefit from a dashboard that uses this data?
- What industries or businesses might benefit from using dashboards more than others?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below

```Answer
Example of a data source:
- A phone shop company can use sales and inventory data from its point-of-sale system as a dashboard data source. This includes phone models sold, prices, stock levels, customer purchases, and dates, giving a clear record of daily business activity.

Benefit of using a dashboard:
- Using this data in a dashboard helps the phone shop monitor sales performance and inventory in real time. Managers can quickly identify best-selling models, slow-moving stock, and low inventory levels, allowing better restocking decisions and improved profit control.

Industries that benefit most:
- Retail businesses, especially phone shops and electronics stores, benefit greatly from dashboards. These businesses deal with frequent transactions, changing customer demand, and inventory risks. Dashboards help them respond quickly, reduce losses, and stay competitive in a fast-moving market.

<u>Big Data</u>
4 V's of Big Data:

| Volume             | Variety                    | Velocity                         | Veracity                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| The amount of data | The different kind of data | How fast the data can be proceed The quality and reliability of data y  |
- **Problem Domain** is a specific area of analysis encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem.
- **Structure thinking** is a process of reorganizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities and identify the options
- **Turnover Rate** is a rate that employees leave company
- **Scope of work (SOW)** is an agreed-upon outline of the work you're going to perform on a project. Consists of 4 main points such as `Deliverable`, `Timeline`, `Milestones`, `Reports`
	 Differentiate Statement of work from Scope of work:
	- On the other hand, don't confuse with Statement of Work (SOW). Make sure you can differentiate Statement of Work from Scope of work 
	- **A statement of work** is a document that clearly identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs.
	- **A scope of work** is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries of a project. A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes.![[Screenshot 2026-01-09 at 10.10.07 in the morning.png]]

## Reflection

Consider what you’ve learned about working with datasets to formulate SMART questions, crafting an SOW, and performing data analytics in this reflection:
- Why is it important to create SMART questions about your datasets? How do these questions benefit your work as a data professional?
- Why is it important to determine your SMART questions and answers before crafting an SOW?
- Why is it important to perform data analysis on datasets?
    
Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

```ANSWER
- Creating SMART questions ensures that analytical objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.This clarity guides data preparation, analysis, and interpretation while reducing ambiguity. For a data professional, SMART questions improve efficiency, support reproducibility, and ensure that insights directly address real decision-making needs.
- Defining SMART questions and expected answers before drafting an SOW establishes a clear analytical direction and scope.
- Data analysis transforms raw data into meaningful insights that support informed decisions. It helps identify patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies that are not immediately visible. Without proper analysis, datasets provide limited value, whereas structured analysis enables evidence-based conclusions, risk reduction, and strategic planning.
