    "\n",
    "## 🌍 What is NLP?\n",
    "- **Definition**: NLP is the field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  \n",
    "- **Analogy**: Just like you’re doing now — listening to words, forming comprehension.  \n",
    "- **Key Role**: Acts as the bridge between **unstructured text** (human language) and **structured data** (machine-readable form).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Two Directions of NLP\n",
    "- **NLU (Natural Language Understanding)** → Unstructured ➝ Structured  \n",
    "- **NLG (Natural Language Generation)** → Structured ➝ Unstructured  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Common Use Cases\n",
    "1. **🌐 Machine Translation**  \n",
    "   - Translates text across languages while preserving **context**.  \n",
    "   - Bad example: *“The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak”* → Russian → English → *“The vodka is good, but the meat is rotten.”*  \n",
    "   - Shows why context matters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📱 Virtual Assistants & Chatbots**  \n",
    "   - Voice-based: Siri, Alexa (derive commands).  \n",
    "   - Text-based: Chatbots (traverse decision trees).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **😊 Sentiment Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Detects tone/emotion in reviews, emails, social posts.  \n",
    "   - E.g., Is text **positive**, **negative**, or **sarcastic**?  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📧 Spam Detection**  \n",
    "   - Identifies junk mail by patterns (bad grammar, urgency, repeated words).  \n",

    "Steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔤 Tokenization** → Break text into words/tokens.  \n",
    "   - *“Add eggs and milk to my shopping list”* → 8 tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🌱 Stemming** → Reduce words to their root form.  \n",
    "   - *running, ran, runs → run*.  \n",
    "   - ❌ Problem: *university ≠ universe*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **📖 Lemmatization** → Dictionary-based root word.  \n",
    "   - *better → good* (lemm), not *bet* (stem).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📝 Part-of-Speech Tagging** → Identify grammatical role.  \n",
    "   - *“make dinner” → verb*  \n",
    "   - *“what make is your laptop” → noun*  \n",
