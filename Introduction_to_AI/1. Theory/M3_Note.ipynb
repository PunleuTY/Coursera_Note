    "- **Cutting-edge** : In technology term, it refers to most `advanced`, `modern`, `innovative tools`, or `techniques` avaible in a specific fields, representing forefront(most important position or place in a specific field) of scientific and technological progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG** is a `cutting-edge` approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of *retrieval-based* and *generation-based* models. This hybrid method is particularly effective for tasks that require generating informative and contextually relevant text, such as question answering, dialogue systems, and content creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process of RAG\n",
    "There are three main phase of process of RAG : \n",
    "- Given a query, the model retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a predefined corpus or database\n",
    "- These retrieved documents are used to augment the input to the generative model, providing it with additional context.\n",
    "- The generative model uses both the original query and the retrieved information to generate a response, ensuring that the output is both contextually rich and factually grounded. This process enhances the accuracy and relevance of the generated content, addressing many limitations of standalone generative models.\n",

    "## 3. 📝 Limited Context Window\n",
