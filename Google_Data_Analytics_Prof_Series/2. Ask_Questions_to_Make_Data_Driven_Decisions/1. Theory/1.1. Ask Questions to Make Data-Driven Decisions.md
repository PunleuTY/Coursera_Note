### From issue to action: 6 data analysis phase

***Step 1: Ask***
It’s impossible to solve a problem if i don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

* Define the problem I'm trying to solve 

* Make sure I fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

* Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

* Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

* Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

* Questions to ask myself in this step:
  * What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
  *  Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

***Step 2: Prepare***
I will decide what data I need to collect in order to answer my questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. I might use your business task to decide: 
* What metrics to measure
* Locate data in your database
* Create security measures to protect that data
* Questions to ask myself in this step:
  * What do i need to figure out how to sovle this problem?
  * What research do i need to do?

***Step 3: Process***
Clean data is the best data and I will need to clean up my data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

* Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 
* Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
* Removing repeated entries
* Checking as much as possible for bias in the data
* Questions to ask my self:
  * What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
  * How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

***Step 4: Analyze***
I will want to think analytically about my data. At this stage, i might sort and format my data to make it easier to: 

* Perform calculations

* Combine data from multiple sources

* Create tables with your results
* Questions to ask myself:
  * What story is my data telling me?
  * How will my data help me solve this problem?
  * Who needs my company's product or service? What type of person is mot likely to use it

![alt text](image-4.png)
***Step 5: Share***
Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize my results with clear and enticing visuals of my analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is a chance to show the stakeholders I have solved their problem and how I got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  
* Make better decisions

* Make more informed decisions

* Lead to stronger outcomes

* Successfully communicate your findings
* Question to ask mines in this step:
  * How can i make what i present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
  * What would help me understand this if i were the listener?

***Step 6: Act***
Now it’s time to act on the data. I will take everything I have learned from my data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing my stakeholders with recommendations based on my findings so they can make data-driven decisions.
* Questions to ask :
  * How can i use the feedback i received during the share phase to actually meet the stakeholders's need and expectations?
