- Bias is a preference that can be conscious or subconscious, affecting judgments and decisions.
- Data bias is an error that skews results, often due to unrepresentative sample groups or poorly designed surveys
	- Type of Bias
		- Sampling bias occurs when the sample you collect for your research does not accurately represent the larger population you are studying. 
		- Observer bias (experimenter bias, research bias): the tendency for different people to observe things differently. 
		  For example, two scientists may see different things under a microscope.
		- Interpretation Bias: the tendency to always interpret ambiguous situation in a positive or negative way which can lead to varied conclusions from the same data
		- Confirmation bias: the tendency to search for or intepret infomation in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs

To Identify the good data source, we can follow the <u>ROCCC</u> which are:
- R - Reliable 
- O - Original
- C - Comprehensive
- C - Current
- C - Cited 

=> Otherwise, they could be called the Bad Data source

6 aspect of data ethics 
- `Ownership` - Individual own the raw data they provided and they have primary control over its usage, how it's processed, and how it's started. 
- `Transaction transparency` - All data-processing activities and algorithms should be complexity explainable and understood by individual who provides their data 
- `Consent` - An individual's right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provides it. 
- `Currency` - Individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transaction
- `Privacy` - Preserving a data subject's information and activities any time a data transaction occurs.
- `Openness`  -  Free access, usage, sharing data


Data Anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information.
- **Personally identifiable information**, or **PII**, is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity.
- Data Anonymization techniques often involve `blanking`, `hashing`, or `masking` `personal` `information`, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.
- `Role of data anonymization`: Organizations have a responsibility to protect their data and the personal information that data might contain. As a data analyst, you might be expected to understand what data needs to be anonymized, but you generally wouldn't be responsible for the data anonymization itself. A rare exception might be if you work with a copy of the data for testing or development purposes. In this case, you could be required to anonymize the data before you work with it.
- `Example`: Healthcare and financial data are two of the most sensitive types of data. These industries rely a lot on data anonymization techniques. After all, the stakes are very high. That’s why data in these two industries usually goes through **de-identification**, which is **a process used to wipe data clean of all personally identifying information**.
- Here is a list of data that is often anonymized:
	- Telephone numbers
	- Names
	- License plates and license numbers
	- Social security numbers
	- IP addresses
	- Medical records
	- Email addresses
	- Photographs
	- Account numbers
